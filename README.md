# Tera File Editor

A full functioning text editor with limited syntax highlighting for common programming file extensions.

This was made as a personal C learning project. It's based on the [Kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) text editor and adds features not seen in that version. The two main features being additional syntax highlighting and line numbers.
